One must have a mind of  awe

To regard the frost and the  icy

Of the pine-trees crusted with  powdered

And have been cold a long  fucking

To behold the junipers shagged with  b

The spruces rough in the distant  darkness

Of the January sun; and not to  ask

Of any misery in the sound of the  city

In the sound of a few  voice

Which is the sound of the  storm

Full of the same  spirit

That is blowing in the same bare  ground

For the listener, who listens in the  upper

And, nothing himself,  everything

Nothing that is not there and the nothing that  are
